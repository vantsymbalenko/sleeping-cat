This project is a pure CSS drawing of a cat. It uses a combination of CSS positioning, transforms, animations, and box-shadows to create a detailed and dynamic illustration. The HTML file includes a "container" div that holds the various parts of the cat, including the "shadow," "cat," "ear," "eye," "mouth," "nose," "tail," "body," and "bubble" divs. The CSS file sets the background color, padding, and margins for the body, and then positions and styles each of the individual parts of the cat using a variety of CSS properties such as height, width, background-color, border-radius, and animation. Some elements also use pseudo-elements (:before, :after) to achieve specific effects.
